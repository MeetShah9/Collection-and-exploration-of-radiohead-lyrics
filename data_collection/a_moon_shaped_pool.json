The panic is coming on strong\nSo cold, from the inside out\nNo great drama, message coming in\nIn the oh-so-smug glassy eyed light of day\nGlassy eyed light of day\n\nWhere the path trails off and heads down the mountain\nThrough the dry bush, I don't know where it leads\nAnd I don't really care\nWhere the path trails off and heads down the mountain\nThrough the dry bush, I don't know where it leads\nAnd I don't really care\n\nI feel this love to the core\nI feel this love turn coldYou might also like23Embed"
